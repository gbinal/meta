The unofficial motto of 18F is 'Delivery is the Strategy'.  Much of 18F's work is intangible, such as advising on contracts or recruitment as a service, but the below are some delivery projects we've shipped and resources we've developed.  Hopefully, this helps share a bit about what the team does.  These are highlights - to find many more, check out [GitHub.com/18F](https://github.com/18f).  (P.S. Feel free to update the page yourself or suggest an addition [here](https://github.com/18F/meta/issues/7)).
